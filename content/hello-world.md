# The Journey Begins

This is the first paragraph of my completely custom, SEO-optimized blog.

Because I am using standard Markdown, I can easily include things like:

- Bullet points
- **Bold text**
- [Links to other sites](https://github.com)

> "Building your own tools gives you the ultimate freedom."

## Why TypeScript?

Using TypeScript allows me to write robust generator code. By combining `marked` and `gray-matter`, I have total control over my site's HTML, resulting in perfect Google Lighthouse scores!
