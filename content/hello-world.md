# The Journey Begins

This is the first paragraph of my completely custom, SEO-optimized blog.

## Example Code

Here is a quick example of a Javascript function I use in this blog to calculate reading time:

```javascript
// Calculate read time based on 200 words per minute
function getReadTime(text) {
  const words = text.trim().split(/\s+/).length;
  return Math.ceil(words / 200);
}

console.log(`Read time: ${getReadTime("Hello World!")} min`);
```
